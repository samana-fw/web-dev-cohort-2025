         It emphasizes hospitality, coexistence among ethnic groups, and special celebrations such as Nowruz. 
         Traditional leisure activities include visiting places like Paghman and Band-e-Amir; however, in recent years, insecurity has limited these recreational opportunities. In clothing styles and wedding customs, a combination of tradition and modernity can be seen. Cultural practices such as preparing Haft Mewa and Sabzi Palak during Nowruz are common,

    <h1>Afghan Clothes</h1>
    <p>
       The culture of women’s clothing in Afghanistan, particularly in Kabul, is a rich combination of vibrant colors, ethnic patterns, and traditional handicrafts that reflect the country’s identity, history, and cultural diversity. Key elements include the gand or katak (long dress), Afghan trousers, and various decorative techniques such as coin embroidery, mirror work, and hand embroidery. These outfits are often combined with the burqa or chador for special occasions such as weddings. In large cities like Kabul,
        Western-style clothing is also common; however, under Taliban rule, strict dress restrictions have been imposed.
<h2>Main Features of Afghan/Kabuli Women’s Clothing:</h2>
	<h4>•	Gand or Katak:</h4> Long, loose dresses in a wide range of bright colors symbolizing joy and authenticity.
     They are often decorated with colorful embroidery and worn during celebrations.
	<h4>•	Afghan Trousers:</h4> Soft, comfortable, usually loose trousers tied at the waist with an azarband (a fabric drawstring).
	<h4>•	Decorations:</h4> Mirror embroidery (especially common among Kuchis), coin embroidery, beadwork, and hand-stitched patterns. 
    Each ethnic group has its own distinctive decorative style.
	<h4>•	Head Coverings (Chador/Burqa):</h4> The use of the chador or burqa is common in different regions and for certain occasions.
     Taliban regulations have enforced full covering, including the wearing of the burqa.
	<h4>•	Ethnic Diversity:</h4> Each ethnic group—Pashtun, Tajik, Hazara, Uzbek, and others—has its own traditional clothing style. For example, Hazaras often use printed cotton fabrics and felt, while Turkmen women are known for their unique and elaborate decorations.<br>

<h4>Differences and Cultural Influences:</h4>
	•	In Urban Areas (such as Kabul): Western-style clothing, such as jeans, is popular in everyday life, while traditional outfits are reserved for weddings, Nowruz, and religious holidays.<br>
	•	In Rural and Tribal Areas: Traditional clothing with stronger decorations and clearer expressions of ethnic identity is more common. Among Pashtun communities, women typically wear long dresses, trousers, loose garments, and chadors.<br>
	•	Impact of the Taliban: After the Taliban came to power, strict dress codes were enforced, banning Western clothing for both women and men and making the burqa mandatory. After their fall, diversity in clothing returned to the markets; however, at present, restrictions have again been imposed.<br>

In summary, Afghan women’s clothing represents a rich history, skilled handicrafts, and ethnic diversity. Through its unique colors, patterns, and decorations, it powerfully expresses Afghanistan’s cultural identity.
