          <h1>About <span>Ghazni</span></h1>
          <p>
            Ghazni Province is one of the important, historical, and populous
            provinces of southeastern Afghanistan, with the city of Ghazni as
            its capital. Due to its strategic location on the Kabul–Kandahar
            highway, its diverse ethnic composition (Pashtun, Hazara, Tajik, and
            others), and its rich cultural heritage, it is also recognized as
            the “Cultural Capital of the Islamic World.” Ghazni has a
            significant place in Afghan history, having been the capital of the
            Ghaznavid Empire in the 10th and 11th centuries. The province is
            home to many historical sites, including ancient fortresses,
            mosques, and mausoleums, reflecting its rich cultural heritage. The
            economy of Ghazni is primarily based on agriculture, livestock, and
            trade, with many residents engaged in farming and herding.
